   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the CXF JAX-RS beans.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the artifact is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the CXF JAX-RS namespaces.
